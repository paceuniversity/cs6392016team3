AppDock Readme

The team consists of Andrew Greenberg, Vanessa Rene, and Fabian Patino from CS613 summer session 2016 at Pace University.

Our Procedure:
  We first created a wiki outlining the main idea for our project and the reasoning behind it. Our second step was to create a design for the UI.
  Each team member contributed with ideas and communicated what would work or not.  (These preliminary sketches can be found in the sketches folder.
  Once a basic layout was decided upon, we each completed certain pages and linked them together.  Upon seeing the first version we decided to twaek the UI
  to create a simplified UI.  A lot of the work went into the user experience.  We skipped over some more traditional types of menus 
  based on our target users, and instead included easy to access buttons.  Our work was to create an intuitive design for first time technology
  users.
  On top of this we revised and included material design elements in the form of the color schemes dictated by Google.  The first version 
  of the code was also broken into fragments to compy with the standards of Android development design.  As with any project, this is still
  going through iterations of changes to further meet our goals.
  For the purpose of this class, and a unified experience we are focusing on a clean looking portrait mode that will work on standard
  5 inch screen size.  Since we are utilizing fragments we will be able to create different layouts as needed.
