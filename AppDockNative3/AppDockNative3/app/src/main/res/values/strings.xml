    <string name="beyeBioText">Ousseynou Khadim Bèye, a Senegalese
        indie games developer, has transposed that thinking onto a
        more socio-politically charged game.\n\n

        Cross Dakar City, an app available for free on Android and iOS
        devices, features Mamadou, a Senegalese child beggar (“enfant talibé”),
        who is trying to cross the streets of Dakar in order to find his parents
        and return home. Mamadou has to avoid fast-moving vehicles, trains, bombs,
        and rivers during the six levels of the game.\n\n

        “I wanted to make something that had a positive impact on Sénégal,
        and to reach the widest public as possible with this game and highlight
        the issue of child begging in Sénégal,” Bèye told me over the phone.\n\n
